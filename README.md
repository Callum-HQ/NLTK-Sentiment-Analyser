# NLTK Sentiment Analysis Tool
Sentiment Analysis using NLTK for my CGS Internship 2023 for a student researcher (More details in README)

Download NLTK using 'pip install nltk' 

NOTE: I did NOT include ACTUAL research data in the codes due to confidentiality of respondents. You may edit the code to add in your own data to analyse. *As per requests, I have input SAMPLE responses into the student_data container*

Contact me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kairostay/) or the student researcher's [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaeden-l-173ab026b) for more info.
