# CGS-Internship-NTLK-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis using NLTK for my CGS Internship 2023 for a student researcher (More details in README)

Download NLTK using 'pip install nltk' 

NOTE: I did NOT include ACTUAL research data in the codes due to confidentiality of respondents. You may edit the code to add in your own data to analyse. *As per requests, I have input SAMPLE responses into the student_data container*
